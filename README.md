# LIA
Summer research project on LIA

As part of the summer research projects at UiO, Ragnhild and I will be working with Kicki Kr√ºger on climate impacts during the Little Ice Age (LIA). We are using some PMIP4 data and will plot different variables to understand the impacts, and possibly see how well the model agrees on what scientists have found with other written sources and proxies. The work includes a lot of literature review and own results from using others data. Our results will be compared with other studies, and the work will end up in a popular science article or a poster presentation, suitable for the museum of natural history.
