# LIA
Summer research project on LIA

As part of the summer research projects at UiO, Ragnhild and I will be working with Kicki Krüger on climate impacts during the Little Ice Age (LIA). We are using some PMIP4 data and will plot different variables to understand the impacts, and possibly see how well the model agrees on what scientists have found with other written sources and proxies. The work includes a lot of literature review and own results from using others data. Our results will be compared with other studies, and the work will end up in a popular science article or a poster presentation, suitable for the museum of natural history.

Outline of project work / deliverables:
1. Participate at the Nordic LIA workshop at CAS in 2.-3. June.
2. Search for literature on the Little Ice Age and PMIP4.
3. Define major volcanic events and periods to focus on during the LIA.
4. Visit “The LIA” Klimahuset exhibition; consider interviews.
5. Search for new PMIP4 model data with improved volcanic forcing.
6. Analyse and visualize the new PMIP4 model data with improved volcanic forcing with respect to:
-Climate effects on Scandinavia versus the Northern Hemisphere.
-Validate with climate proxies (tree rings, ice cores) and observations (instrumental).
-Explore society effects.
-What is different to PMIP3?
-Compare LIA with LALIA events.
7. Deliver eventual a popular science product in form of an oral/poster presentation or a
contribution to a museum exhibition.
