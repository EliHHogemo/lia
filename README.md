Summer research project on LIA

As part of the summer research projects at UiO, Ragnhild and I will be working with Kicki Kr√ºger on climate impacts during the Little Ice Age (LIA). We are using some PMIP4 data and plot different variabler to understand the impacts, and possibly see how well the model agrees on what scientists have found with other written sources and proxies. The work includes a lot of literature review and own results from using others data.
